This is my test file, for testing branches and stuff.

Apparently, branches are just copies of the master, as master was at the time the branch was created. Cool!


#Pull Requests
Here is my edit, to test out the pull request feature.


Even after the pull request, this branch still exists. Branched don't dissapear when they are merged with the master.
I suppose a better terminology would be "copy then merge the copy", but whatever. I guess that's too verbose for github.

I'm just going to "merge" this edit too.
